    <p><b>Transit Talk</b> is a Ruby on Rails web app based on a data standard called GTFS, which makes storing transit station and route information quite simple.
    <br><br>
    We’ve tried to create Transit Talk in a way that allows for a coder in any given city to plug in a couple lines of code and immediately have a beautiful, functioning issue reporting system for their local public transit network.

    <p>You don’t need to know what much about GTFS to create a version of <b>Transit Talk</b> for your city. Simply head over to out GitHub repository, create a fork of the app, and follow the instructions to build and install an instance of your own! </p>
