    <p>Here at <b>Transit Talk</b>, we aim to create a transparent record of the issues riders encounter on their commutes, empowering them to make educated decisions about their commutes while also encouraging transit agencies to become more responsive to the needs of their riders.

    <p>As a team of volunteers of varying transit-riding backgrounds, we understand the problems commuters face when using public transit. We aim to make everyoneâ€™s commute simpler, and to allow them to make educated choices on each trip. </p>

    <p>Transit information should be open and easily accessible. We hope to bridge the gap between transit administrations and their users, and to allow users to have some control over their commutes. <p>
